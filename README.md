# pure

I almost finished [haskellbook](www.haskellbook.com), and I'm looking for a convenient way to write Haskell in the browser. After a good lookaround even bits of the `GHCJS` documentation suggest that I use Purescript instead. So I'll bite the bullet and try to get used to it as I am eager to start using it in the real world.
